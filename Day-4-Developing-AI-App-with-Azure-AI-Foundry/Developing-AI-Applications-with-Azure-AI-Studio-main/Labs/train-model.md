# Lab 01: Training the Model

### Estimated Duration: 45 Minutes

## Lab scenario

In this lab, you will gain hands-on experience in initializing a Prompt Flow project in Azure AI foundry, setting up the necessary environment to begin developing, testing, and refining AI applications. You will create and customize prompts within Azure AI foundry's Prompt Flow. Starting with the creation of a new flow, you will add and configure the Prompt tool and develop a flow incorporating LLM (Large Language Model) and Prompt tools. By authoring a sample flow and running it with custom inputs, you'll learn how to monitor flow execution and evaluate outputs, thereby understanding the practical steps involved in developing, testing, and refining AI-driven workflows.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will perform the following:

- Task 1 : Initialize a Prompt Flow Project
- Task 2 : Create and Customize Prompts
- Task 3 : Develop a Flow with LLM and Prompt Tools


## Task 1: Initialize a Prompt Flow Project

As involves setting up a structured environment to manage and streamline prompt-based AI tasks. This process typically includes creating a project directory, configuring necessary files and dependencies, and establishing a workflow for prompt design, testing, and iteration. By organizing prompts, data, and evaluation metrics in a centralized system, the project ensures consistent and efficient development, making it easier to refine prompts and achieve desired outcomes.

1. Open a new tab, and navigate to the [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?reloadCount=1). Select **Sign in**. When prompted, enter the following Azure credentials.

### Task 2 : Create and Customize Prompts

Creating and customizing prompts involves designing specific, targeted questions or statements to elicit desired responses or actions. This process includes defining clear objectives, understanding the audience, and using precise language to ensure clarity and relevance. Customization can further refine prompts to align with particular contexts or user needs, enhancing engagement and effectiveness in various applications such as education, customer service, and AI interactions.

1. From the left navigation menu, under **My assets**, select **Model + endpoints (1)**.

1. On the **Manage deployments of your models, apps, and services**, under **Model deployments** tab, select **+ Deploy model (2)** and then select **+ Deploy base model (3)** from the dropdown.

1. On the **Select a model** page, search and select **gpt-4 (1)**, select **Confirm (2)** under the **gpt-4**.

   ![](./media/new-develop-issue-2.png)

1. On **Deploy model gpt-4** page :

    - Deployment name : **gpt-4 (1)**
    - Deployment type : **Global standard (2)**
    - Select **Customize (3)**

      ![](./media/gpt-4-1.png)

1. On **Deploy model gpt-4** page, follow these instructions to create the deployment:

   - Deployment name : **gpt-4 (1)**
   - Deployment type :  **Global Standard (2)**
   - Model version : **turbo-2024-04-09 (3)**
   - Connected Azure OpenAI resource : make sure to select which contain your deployment id **ai-modelhub<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>xxxxxxxx_aoai**
   - Tokens per Minute Rate Limit (thousands): **10 K(4)**
      > **Note**: Use the &rarr; (right arrow) key on the keyboard to set the Enqueued Tokens (Limit) to 5k.

### Task 3 : Develop a Flow with LLM and Prompt Tools

Developing a flow with Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt tools involves designing a structured interaction where the LLM is guided by carefully crafted prompts to generate desired outputs. This process typically includes defining the objective, selecting appropriate LLMs, and iteratively refining prompts based on the model's responses to ensure accuracy and relevance. Prompt tools assist in managing and optimizing this interaction, enabling more efficient and effective use of LLMs in tasks such as content creation, data analysis, and automated customer support.

1. The prompt flow authoring page opens. You can start authoring your flow now. By default you see a sample flow. This example flow has nodes for the LLM and Python tools.

1. Optionally, you can add more tools to the flow. The visible tool options are **LLM, Prompt, and Python**. To view more tools, select **+ More tools**.

1. From the **Graph**, select **joke**. Choose an existing connection **ai-modelhub<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>xxxxxxxx_aoai** from the drop-down menu, and for deployment, select the newly created deployment, **gpt-4**, in the LLM tool editor.
