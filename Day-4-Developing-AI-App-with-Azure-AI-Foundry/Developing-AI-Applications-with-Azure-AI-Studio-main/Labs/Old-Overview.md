It covers the full development lifecycle, including initialization, experimentation, evaluation, refinement, and deployment. Participants will explore various flow types, such as Standard, Chat, and Evaluation, while learning how flows and nodes enable efficient data processing and task execution.

- **Building and Customizing Prompt Flows**: In this lab, you will gain practical experience in setting up and managing a Prompt Flow project within Azure AI Foundry. You will begin by initializing the project and configuring the development environment to support the creation, testing, and refinement of AI applications. The lab will guide you through designing and customizing prompts, starting with the creation of a new flow, integrating the Prompt tool, and incorporating Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities. By building and executing a sample flow with custom inputs, you will learn how to monitor execution, analyze outputs, and refine workflows, providing a comprehensive understanding of AI-driven application development.

- **Evaluation Flow Setup**: This lab focuses on setting up and analyzing evaluation flows for an AI model in Azure AI Foundry. You will systematically review model responses to diverse inputs, assessing performance based on key evaluation criteria. By defining and applying metrics like coherence and fluency, you will automate the evaluation process using a structured dataset. Through this hands-on experience, you will develop a deeper understanding of model assessment techniques and optimization strategies to improve AI performance.

- **Fine-Tuning Prompts for Optimal Performance**: This lab focuses on fine-tuning prompts to optimize AI model performance and enhance response quality. You will explore techniques for iterative prompt refinement, evaluate different prompt variations, and analyze their impact on model outputs. Additionally, you will work on optimizing flow performance to ensure efficiency and reliability in production environments. By the end of this lab, you will have a deeper understanding of how to systematically improve AI-generated responses and streamline workflow execution for real-world applications.

- **Implementing Chat Flow and Tool Integration**: Implementing and testing chat flows involves creating and evaluating the interactions between a user and a chatbot or automated messaging system. This process begins with designing the conversation paths, including potential user inputs and corresponding system responses, to ensure that the chatbot can effectively address various scenarios. After implementation, thorough testing is conducted to identify and rectify any issues, ensuring the chat flow is intuitive, accurate, and capable of handling diverse user interactions. The goal is to deliver a seamless and efficient user experience, refining the chat flow based on test results to improve functionality and user satisfaction.

- **Ensure Responsible AI Practices AI with Content Safety**:This lab offers hands-on experience in applying responsible AI principles using Azure AI Foundry. Participants will explore key aspects such as fairness, transparency, privacy, and security while utilizing Azure’s built-in Responsible AI tools. The session focuses on identifying and addressing biases, enhancing model interpretability, implementing privacy-preserving techniques, and ensuring security and compliance adherence.
