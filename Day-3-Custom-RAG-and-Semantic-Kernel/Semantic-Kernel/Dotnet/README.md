# AI Developer - Azure AI Foundry and Semantic Kernel Fundamentals

## Introduction

The Azure AI Foundry and Semantic Kernel Fundamentals is an introduction to understanding the conceptual foundations of infusing your application with AI using the Semantic Kernel development kit. Materials from this workshop can serve as a foundation for building your own AI infused solutions with Semantic Kernel.

This workshop consists of eight challenges and is designed to encourage learning and research. If you want a deeper understanding of how to implement an AI solution but have little or no experience with OpenAI or Semantic Kernel then this workshop is for you.

We recommend to host this as a team based activity where students work in groups of 3-5 people to solve the challenges. Each challenge is designed to be completed in 30-90 minutes.

## Learning Objectives

This workshop is designed for individuals who want to gain practical experience in working with Azure AI Foundry and Semantic Kernel. By applying this knowledge, you will be able to integrate AI into your own applications.

Participants will learn how to:

- Build a simple chat using Semantic Kernel and C#
- Add plugins and enable auto calling to create Planners
- Import existing APIs using OpenAPI
- Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Document Chunking
  - Grounding AI
- Working with Image generation
- Multi-Agent workflows
